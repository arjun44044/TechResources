# Operating System and its Need

### ✅ What is an Operating System (OS)?

An **Operating System (OS)** is **system software** that acts as an **intermediary** between the user and the computer hardware. It manages **hardware resources** and provides **services** for running applications.

> 📌 Think of it as the **manager** of the computer: it ensures everything runs smoothly, from programs to hardware interactions.

### ✅ Why Do We Need an Operating System?

Here’s  **why an OS is essential** :

#### 1. **Hardware Management**

* **Controls and coordinates** the use of the CPU, memory, disk drives, printers, etc.
* Without an OS, each app would need to manage all hardware on its own.

#### 2. **Program Execution**

* Loads programs into memory and runs them.
* Handles process creation, scheduling, and termination.

#### 3. **Memory Management**

* Allocates and frees memory space as needed.
* Keeps track of each byte in a system’s memory.

#### 4. **File System Management**

* Provides a way to store, organize, and access data on storage devices.
* Handles file naming, directories, permissions, etc.

#### 5. **User Interface**

* Offers CLI (Command Line Interface) or GUI (Graphical User Interface).
* Makes it easier for users to interact with the computer.

#### 6. **Security and Access Control**

* Protects data and system resources from unauthorized access.
* Manages users and permissions.

#### 7. **Multitasking**

* Allows multiple programs to run at the same time.
* Efficiently switches between tasks using the CPU.

#### 8. **Device Management**

* Manages communication with all input/output devices using drivers.

⭐ Both TikTok and Pubg doesn't know the existance of each other thereby interference of each other 's codebase for max resource utilization, hacking, unethical competition etc

### ✅ Examples of Operating Systems

* **Desktop/Laptop** : Windows, macOS, Linux
* **Mobile** : Android, iOS
* **Server/Cloud** : Ubuntu Server, Red Hat, Windows Server
* **Embedded** : RTOS (Real-time OS), embedded Linux (used in routers, TVs, etc.)

# Types of OS

![1751375018227](image/OperatingSystem/1751375018227.png)

Here's a  **detailed breakdown of the types of Operating Systems** , categorized based on how they handle tasks, users, and hardware:

### ✅ 1. **Batch Operating System**

📌 What it is:

* Users **submit jobs** (programs with data) to the system in a  **batch** .
* The OS **executes jobs one by one** without user interaction during execution.

🛠 How it works:

* Uses **job control language (JCL)** to define job instructions.
* Common in early mainframe systems.

✅ Features:

* No real-time interaction.
* Efficient for processing large volumes of similar jobs.

📍 Example:

* IBM’s early OS like **OS/360**
* ATLAS

🔥 Can it fulfill OS Goals (As shown in Paper)---- No

> ✅ **Batch Operating Systems** **used punch cards** — especially in the early days of computing.
>
> ##### 🟨 What were  **Punch Cards** ?
>
> A **punch card** (also called a  **Hollerith card** ) was a **paper card** where **holes were punched** in specific positions to represent data or instructions. Each card could hold  **one line of code or data** .
>
> ##### 🛠 How Punch Cards Worked in Batch OS:
>
> 1. **Users wrote programs** (e.g., in FORTRAN or COBOL) by **punching holes** into cards — one card per line.
> 2. They submitted a **stack (batch)** of these cards to the computer operator.
> 3. The operator  **fed the cards into a card reader** , which read the holes as input.
> 4. The **Batch OS** stored these jobs, queued them, and ran them  **sequentially** .
> 5. The **output** was printed later, often on **paper printouts** or stored on magnetic tapes.
>
> ##### 🧠 Real-Life Analogy:
>
> Think of punch cards like:
>
> * A **paper version of a USB drive** — you give your "program" to the system.
> * The computer **reads the holes** to understand what to do.
> * But unlike today, you can’t "edit" — you have to **re-punch** a new card if you make a mistake!
>
> ##### 📸 Visual (for imagination):
>
> * A punch card looked like a **rectangular piece of cardboard** with  **rows and columns** .
> * Holes in specific positions = binary code (0s and 1s).

### ✅ 2. **Single-Process Operating System**

* **Meaning** : The OS can execute  **only one process at a time** .
* **Even if a user opens multiple apps** , only  **one can run at a time** .
* No **true multitasking** (not even background processing).

🔸 Examples:

* **MS-DOS** → true single-process OS
  * If you run a program, the entire system is dedicated to that one task.

🔥 Can it fulfill OS Goals (As shown in Paper)---- No

![1751375888861](image/OperatingSystem/1751375888861.png)

### ✅ 3. Multiprogramming Operating System

A **Multiprogramming Operating System** is an OS that allows **multiple programs** to **reside in memory at the same time** and  **share the CPU** ,  **one at a time** .

> 📌 It increases **CPU utilization** by keeping the CPU  **busy all the time** , switching to another program when one is waiting (e.g., for I/O).

##### 🛠 How Multiprogramming Works:

1. **Multiple programs** are loaded into memory.
2. The **OS picks one program** to run.
3. If the program **needs to wait** (e.g., for input/output), the CPU is **switched** to another ready program.
4. This  **cycle continues** , ensuring the CPU is  **not idle** .

> 🧠 It does **not mean** all programs run  *at the same time* , but they take turns so efficiently that it *feels* like they are.

##### ✅ Key Components in Multiprogramming:

| Component                   | Role                                                      |
| --------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Job Scheduler**     | Selects which programs to load into memory.               |
| **CPU Scheduler**     | Decides which ready job gets the CPU next.                |
| **Memory Management** | Keeps track of which programs are in memory.              |
| **Context Switching** | Saves and loads the state of processes during CPU switch. |

##### ✅ Features of Multiprogramming OS:

| Feature                                | Description                                                    |
| -------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Increased CPU Utilization**    | CPU is rarely idle.                                            |
| **Faster Throughput**            | More jobs are completed in less time.                          |
| **Efficient Resource Use**       | Better use of memory, CPU, I/O devices.                        |
| **No user interaction required** | Mainly designed for**batch jobs** , not real-time input. |

##### 📍 Examples of Multiprogramming OS:

* **UNIX (early versions)**
* **IBM OS/360**
* **Windows NT kernel** (also supports multitasking)

🔥 Can it fulfill OS Goals (As shown in Paper)---- Yes, But Not good

### ✅ 4. **Time-Sharing Operating System (Multitasking OS)**

📌 What it is:

* Allows **multiple users** to use a computer  **simultaneously** .
* CPU time is divided into **time slices** and given to each user or task.

✅ Features:

* **Fast switching** between tasks.
* Better CPU utilization.
* Each user gets a quick response.

📍 Example:

* UNIX, Multics, Windows (modern versions), Linux

🔥 Can it fulfill OS Goals (As shown in Paper)---- Yes, better then Multiprogramming

### ✅ 5. Multiprocessing Operating System

 ⭐ Multiprocessing OS **does use multiple cores or CPUs**

 ⭐ A **multiprocessing OS** is designed to **simultaneously execute multiple processes** by using  **more than one processing unit (CPU core)** .

##### 🔧 Now OS can do **multiple things at the same time**:

> ✅ If a computer has **multiple CPU cores** (like dual-core, quad-core, octa-core), then the OS can run **true parallel processing** — not just switch quickly, but literally do **multiple things at the same time.**

##### 🔸 Example:

| Term                         | What It Means                                                                     |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Single-core CPU**    | One process at a time (even in multitasking, only one executes at a time)         |
| **Dual-core CPU**      | Two processes can truly run at the same time                                      |
| **Quad-core CPU**      | Four processes can run in parallel                                                |
| **Multiprocessing OS** | Uses these cores efficiently to**assign tasks/processes**to different cores |

##### ✅ Features of Multiprocessing OS:

* **True parallelism** (not just fast switching)
* Better **performance** and **throughput**
* More efficient use of **multi-core processors**
* Can handle more **complex or resource-intensive** tasks

##### 🧠 Analogy:

> Imagine you're in a kitchen:
>
> * With **1 chef** (single-core): only one dish at a time.
> * With **4 chefs** (quad-core): 4 dishes cooking  **simultaneously** .

##### 🖥 Examples of Multiprocessing OS:

* **Modern OSes** like:
