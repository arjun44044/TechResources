## Networking knowledge

Because knowing **computer networking and internet concepts** is *critical* for backend, full-stack, DevOps, and cloud jobs — especially when you're deploying a MERN project on AWS with WebRTC, sockets, JWT, and security in mind.

### ✅ Why Networking Knowledge Matters for You:

* You'll  **deploy APIs** , open  **ports** , configure **firewalls**
* You'll need to know how **clients (frontend)** talk to **servers (backend)**
* You'll troubleshoot  **EC2 access** ,  **WebRTC peer connections** ,  **Cloudinary uploads** , and **JWT security**
* You’ll sound  **very solid in interviews** , especially system design and DevOps rounds

### 🧠 Let’s Break It Down by Phases

#### 🟩 **Phase 1 – Developer-Level Networking**

📅 Time: 3–4 days

🎯 Focus: Enough to **deploy, secure, and debug** MERN apps

| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| What is an IP address (IPv4 vs IPv6)  | Every server/device needs one        |
| DNS – Domain Name System             | How `fitlab.in`maps to an IP       |
| HTTP vs HTTPS                         | How browsers talk to servers         |
| Ports (80, 443, 3000, 27017)          | You’ll open/close ports on EC2      |
| TCP vs UDP                            | WebRTC = UDP, APIs = TCP             |

| Status codes (200, 404, 500, etc.)    | Crucial for API debugging            |
| Firewalls & security groups           | Control access to EC2/Sockets        |
| NAT & public/private IP               | Why EC2 has 2 IPs, WebRTC needs STUN |
| What is a Gateway?                    | Default route from private network   |
| How DNS resolution works              | Custom domains & SSL                 |
| Ping, traceroute, netstat, curl       | CLI tools to test connectivity       |

| DNS (Route 53)                  | Host your domain and point it to EC2             |
| SSL/TLS (HTTPS)                 | Encrypt frontend ↔ backend traffic              |
| STUN & TURN Servers             | Used in WebRTC for peer-to-peer                  |
| IP Tables & UFW                 | Local firewall configuration on Linux            |
