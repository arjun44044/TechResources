# Hosting vs Deployment

The terms **hosting** and **deployment** are often used interchangeably, but they’re **not the same** — especially when you're building full-stack projects like a MERN app.

Here’s a clear breakdown:

#### ⚙️ Hosting vs Deployment — What's the Difference?

| Term                 | Definition                                                                | Analogy                                                      | Tools/Platforms                         |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------------------------------- |
| **Hosting**    | The** location/environment ** where your app runs (server, storage, DB) | Like**renting a house**where your app "lives"          | EC2, Vercel, Render, S3, MongoDB Atlas  |
| **Deployment** | The **process **of putting your app into a hosted environment           | Like**moving into the house**and setting everything up | GitHub Actions, FTP, SSH, Docker, CI/CD |

#### 🔍 More Detailed View

###### 🏡 **Hosting** = *“Where does my app live?”*

* A **host** provides:
  * CPU, RAM, bandwidth
  * Domain/DNS, HTTPS
  * Server (e.g., EC2), file storage (e.g., S3), or DB (e.g., MongoDB Atlas)
* Types of hosting:
  * **Shared Hosting** : Like GoDaddy, Bluehost (not suitable for MERN)
  * **Cloud Hosting** : AWS, GCP, Azure
  * **Platform Hosting** : Vercel, Render, Railway

> Example: "I hosted my frontend on Vercel and my backend on Render."

###### 🚀 **Deployment** = *“How do I get my app onto the host?”*

* Steps involved:
  * Push code from GitHub
  * Build the app (React, Node, etc.)
  * Set environment variables
  * Run start commands (`npm start`, `pm2 start`, etc.)
  * Configure domains, SSL, logs

> Example: "I deployed my Express API to EC2 using GitHub + PM2 + SSH."

#### ✅ In Your Context (MERN Project):

| Task                                         | Is it Hosting or Deployment? |
| -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| Spinning up an EC2 instance                  | **Hosting**            |
| Uploading React build files to S3            | **Deployment**         |
| Running `pm2 start server.js`on EC2        | **Deployment**         |
| Setting up MongoDB Atlas cluster             | **Hosting**            |
| Connecting frontend to backend using API URL | **Deployment task**    |

#### 🔁 Hosting + Deployment Work Together

You **deploy** your app **to** a  **host** .

Example:

> I deployed my MERN stack app to AWS, where the frontend is hosted on S3/CloudFront, and the backend is hosted on EC2. MongoDB Atlas is my database host.

#### ✅ Summary

| 🔑 Term              | 📌 Simple Definition                                      |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Hosting**    | Where your app runs (the cloud/computer it lives on)      |
| **Deployment** | The process of putting your app into that environment     |
| **CI/CD**      | Automated way to deploy continuously on every code change |

# -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

# ---------AWS, NVM, PM2----------------

**AWS (Amazon Web Services)** is a **cloud computing platform** created by Amazon.

#### ✅ Simple Definition:

> **AWS is like renting computers, storage, and tools on the internet instead of owning them.**

So instead of buying your own physical server, setting up routers, storage, etc., you **rent only what you need** from AWS, and only for as long as you need it.

## ------- EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud) -------

**Amazon EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** — one of the **most important and powerful services** on AWS. It’s the core of many real-world deployments, including for example a MERN eCommerce project.

## ----- Introduction

#### 🧠 What is EC2?

**EC2 (Elastic Compute Cloud)** is Amazon's service that provides **virtual servers** in the cloud.

> ✅ Think of EC2 as a **rentable computer in the cloud** that you control — just like your own Linux or Windows system, but hosted on Amazon’s infrastructure.

![1751057440423](image/Hosting/1751057440423.png)

#### 💡 Why Use EC2?

* You can **deploy your backend** here (Node.js, Express, sockets, WebRTC, etc.)
* You can  **host full websites** , APIs, file servers, etc.
* You pay only for what you use
* You have **full control** over the OS, software, networking, and security

#### 🧱 Key Components of EC2

| Component                | Description                                                 |
| ------------------------ | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Instance**       | A single virtual machine (VM) you launch                    |
| **AMI**            | Amazon Machine Image – the OS (e.g., Ubuntu, Amazon Linux) |
| **Instance Type**  | Hardware config – CPU, RAM, etc. (e.g.,`t2.micro`)       |
| **Key Pair**       | SSH key to securely access your EC2 server                  |
| **Security Group** | Virtual firewall – controls ports (HTTP, SSH, etc.)        |
| **Elastic IP**     | Static public IP address for your EC2 instance              |
| **EBS Volume**     | Storage (like your system drive) for EC2 instance           |
| **User Data**      | Script that runs at launch (for auto-setup)                 |

#### 🛠️ How EC2 Works (In Simple Steps)

1. You **launch** an EC2 instance (pick OS, size, settings)
2. You **SSH into the instance** (like using a remote Linux machine)
3. You  **install Node.js** , your backend app, MongoDB client, PM2, etc.
4. You **open ports** (like 80, 3000) in the security group
5. You **run your server** (e.g., `pm2 start server.js`)
6. You can  **set up Nginx** , domains, SSL, etc.

#### ⚙️ Example: Hosting MERN Backend on EC2

| Task                              | Tool or Command                         |
| --------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Launch Ubuntu EC2                 | From AWS Console                        |
| SSH into server                   | `ssh -i mykey.pem ubuntu@<public-ip>` |
| Install Node.js, Git              | `apt install nodejs git`              |
| Clone your backend repo           | `git clone <your-repo>`               |
| Run server                        | `pm2 start server.js`                 |
| Expose port                       | Open 3000 in Security Group             |
| Optional: Set up Nginx            | `apt install nginx`                   |
| Optional: Add SSL (Let's Encrypt) | `certbot`                             |

#### 💸 EC2 Pricing (Free Tier Available)

###### Free Tier:

* `t2.micro` or `t3.micro` = **750 hours/month for 12 months**
* Enough to run **1 server 24/7 for free** (great for projects)

###### After free tier:

* Pay-per-second pricing (e.g., $7–$10/month for small instance)
* Can stop and restart to save cost

#### 🔐 Security in EC2

* **SSH Key Pair:** Used to securely connect (private key stays on your laptop)
* **Security Groups:** Acts like a firewall — you must open ports like:
  * `22` → SSH
  * `80` → HTTP
  * `443` → HTTPS

## Deploying Backend in EC2

1. Create an AWS account
2. Set up an EC2 instance **

   If at some point in the future, you wanted to create an applicationusing the resources you’ve stored on S3, you’ll need to create an
   instance EC2.

**
    2a) Choosing an AMI (Amazon Machine Image):**

    An AMI is a template that is used to create a new instance—or virtual machine—based on user requirements. The AMI will contain 			information  about the software, operating system, volume, and access permissions.
	There are two types of AMIs:

    i) Predefined AMIs: Amazon creates these, and the user can modify them.

    ii) Custom AMIs: The user also creates these, and they can be reused. These AMIs are also available in the AMI Marketplace

**

![1751057705300](image/Hosting/1751057705300.png)

 2b) Choosing an instance type:**

    An instance type specifies the hardware specifications that are required in the machine from the previous step. Instance types belong to
 five main families:

    i) Compute-optimized: For situations that require a lot of high processing power. Good for scientific modeling, ML, gaming, etc

    ii) Memory-optimized: For setting up something to do with your in-memory cache. Good for sites that requres lot of cach memory

    iii) GPU optimized: For setting up a gaming system, or something with the requirement of a large graphic. Good for gaming sites

    iv) Storage optimized: When you need to set up a storage server

    v) General-purpose: When everything is equally balanced

    Instance types are fixed, and their configurations cannot be altered.

**

![1751057497914](image/Hosting/1751057497914.png)
    2c) Configure Instance:**

    You have to specify the number of instances, purchasing options, the kind of network, the subnet, assign a public IP, set the[IAM](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/aws-tutorial/aws-iam "IAM")
 role, the shutdown behavior, etc. On that note, stopping the system and terminating the system under ‘Shutdown behavior’ are completely
different things.

    Stopping = Temporarily shutting down the system

    Terminating = Returning control to Amazon

    Under the advanced details, users can also add bootstrap scripts that  are executed when the virtual machine starts up. It also offers
multiple payment options, such as:

    i) On-demand instances: Can be launched whenever the user requires normal rates

    ii) Reserved instances: These instances are reserved for one year or three years. The entire amount has to be paid upfront or over a span of a few months.

    iii) Spot instances: Bidding goes to the bidder with the highest bid.  These instances are available at a lesser cost than on-demand instances.

![1751057511945](image/Hosting/1751057511945.png)

    **2d) Adding Storage:**

    You’re tasked with deciding the type of storage, which could be:

    i) Ephemeral Storage (temporary and free)

    ii) Amazon Elastic Block Store (permanent and paid)

    iii) Amazon S3

    The size (in GBs), volume type, where the disk is mounted, and whether the volume needs to be encrypted needs to be specified. Freeusers get to access up to 30 GBs of SSD or magnetic storage (which can be found under ‘Volume Type’).

![1751057524168](image/Hosting/1751057524168.png)

![1751057539049](image/Hosting/1751057539049.png)

**2e) Adding tags:**

    This helps to identify instances more quickly.

**
**2f) Configuring security groups:**

    These are used to specify rules based on which users are given access  to the EC2 instance. You set up the type of security, protocol, the
port range, and source (from where the incoming traffic is coming from). Incoming traffic has to be explicitly specified, and outgoing traffic
is open.

**
 **2g) Review**

    Click on ‘Launch’ and the instance is created. However, there’s a little more work to be done.

![AWS Account Login](https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/aws_account.png)

    Fig: This dialog will pop up

    **Private key** : The user downloads the private key

    **Public key** : AWS uses the public key to confirm the identity of the user.

    After choosing to create a new pair, a new private key is downloaded as a .pem file.

    For the next step, we need to use the following tools: PuTTY and PuTTYgen. PuTTY is generally used when you need to connect a Windows  system with a Linux system, which is what we’re doing now. PuTTY doesn’t  accept .pem files.

    So, using the PuTTY Key Generator, you create a new .ppk file, an another format

    Conversion (PuTTYgen can be used for this ). Then insrt the .ppk key

    Now pen PUTTY,

    Select “Save Private Key” and find a location to save the key.

![AWS Account Login](https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/aws_account1.png)

    Fig: In the PuTTY configuration tool, provide your[IP address](https://www.simplilearn.com/tutorials/cyber-security-tutorial/what-is-an-ip-address "IP address") and click on “Connection-Auth”. In browse for private ky for authntication. Clikc browse and find the .ppk file

![AWS Account Login](https://www.simplilearn.com/ice9/free_resources_article_thumb/aws_account2.png)

    After clicking on "Open", will open for example the linux instance using CLI ie a terminal will open up where you can log in as ec2-user for example

## Connecting Linux instance in EC2

To  **get inside your EC2 instance** , you use **SSH (Secure Shell)** — this lets you open a terminal session directly on your cloud server.

Once you gets inside the Linux or Ubuntu Instance, you will see only a terminal so as to communicate with the instance

### ✅ Prerequisites Before You Connect

Make sure you’ve done the following in AWS:

1. ✅ **Launched an EC2 instance**
2. ✅ Selected an **Amazon Linux** or **Ubuntu** AMI
3. ✅ Chosen a `t2.micro` or `t3.micro` (for free tier)
4. ✅ Created and downloaded a **Key Pair** (`.pem` file)
5. ✅ Your **Security Group** has **port 22 (SSH)** open

### -----🚀 3 WAYS TO CONNECT -----

#### 🔥 1. Using SSH

##### 🔑 Step 1: Locate Your `.pem` Key File

* When you launched your EC2 instance, you were prompted to  **create or select a key pair** .
* You must have downloaded a file like:
  ```
  my-key.pem
  ```

> Keep this safe. You **can't connect** without this file.

##### 📍 Step 2: Find Your EC2 Instance Public IP

* Go to the **AWS EC2 Dashboard**
* Click **Instances**
* Note the **Public IPv4 address** (e.g., `3.108.22.55`)

##### 🖥️ Step 3: Open Terminal and Connect

🔹 On **Linux/Mac** (or Windows with WSL or Git Bash):

```bash
chmod 400 my-key.pem  # give proper permissions (only once)

ssh -i my-key.pem ubuntu@<your-ip>
# For Ubuntu AMI: use "ubuntu"
# For Amazon Linux: use "ec2-user"
```

**Example:**

```bash
ssh -i my-key.pem ubuntu@3.108.22.55
```

If your instance uses Amazon Linux:

```bash
ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@3.108.22.55
```

> Only if you're on Mac, Linux, or WSL/Git Bash on Windows:
>
> ```bash
> chmod 400 my-key.pem
> ```
>
> This command restricts file access to keep it secure
>

>
> * Not **writable** or **readable** by others (for security)
> * **Read-only** by the owner
>
> If the key file has wrong permissions, SSH will reject it and give this error:
>
> ```
> UNPROTECTED PRIVATE KEY FILE!
> ```
>
> So `chmod 400` is required to make the `.pem` secure enough for SSH to use.
>
> ##### **⚡ Connect to Your Instance via SSH**
>
> Use this format:
>
> ```bash
> ssh -i /path/to/my-key.pem ubuntu@<public-ip>
> ```

> | Amazon Linux | `ssh -i my-key.pem ec2-user@3.108.22.55` |

#### 🔥 2. Using PuTTY (In your Windows System)

###### 🔹 On **Windows (No WSL/Git Bash)?**

Use **PuTTY** (Windows SSH client):

1. Convert `.pem` to `.ppk` using **PuTTYgen**
2. Open PuTTY → Host: `ubuntu@<your-ip>`
3. Load the `.ppk` key under SSH > Auth > Private Key File

✅ You’re In!

If successful, you'll see:

```bash
Welcome to Ubuntu 22.04 LTS
ubuntu@ip-172-31-xx-xx:~$
```

This is your  **remote Linux machine in the cloud** . You can now:

* Install Node.js
* Clone your repo
* Start your app
* Install nginx or PM2

#### 🛠️ Common Errors & Fixes

| Error                             | Fix                                                                                              |

| Can't find `.pem`file           | Must download it**at the time of instance creation**— or recreate instance with a new key |

#### 🧠 Tip

Use `pm2` to keep your app running in the background:

```bash
npm install -g pm2
pm2 start index.js
pm2 save
```

#### 🔥 3. EC2 Instance Connect

Select the required linux instance from the dashboard and press "Connect". It goes to "EC2 instance Connect" and click connect

## Connecting Windows instance in EC2

If your  **EC2 AMI is a Windows Server** , you  **don’t use SSH like you do with Ubuntu/Linux** . Instead, you connect using  **Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP)** .

##### 🖥️ Connecting to a Windows EC2 Instance (Step-by-Step)

✅ 1. Open AWS Console → EC2 → Instances

* Select your **Windows instance**
* Wait until its **status is "Running"**

✅ 2. Get the Public IPv4 Address

* In the instance details pane, note the **Public IPv4 address**
  > Example: `3.108.22.55`
  >

✅ 3. Select the Instance → Click **Connect** Button (Top Right)

* In the popup:
  * Choose **RDP Client**
  * Click **"Get Password"**

    (Wait ~4 minutes after instance starts)

✅ 4. Decrypt Windows Password

* Upload your `.pem` key file
* AWS will decrypt the **Administrator password**
* Copy it (you'll use it to log in)

✅ 5. Use Remote Desktop (RDP) to Connect

🟢 On Windows:

* Press `Win + R` → type `mstsc` → hit Enter
* In the RDP client:
  * Computer: `3.108.22.55`
  * Username: `Administrator`
  * Password: (paste the decrypted one)

🟢 On Mac:

* Use the **Microsoft Remote Desktop** app (from App Store)
* Add a new PC using:
  * PC name: `3.108.22.55`
  * User: `Administrator`
  * Password: (paste the password)---

> #### 💻 What is  **RDP** ?
>
> **RDP (Remote Desktop Protocol)** is a proprietary protocol developed by Microsoft that allows you to  **remotely connect to another Windows computer/server with a full graphical interface** .
>
> * Developed by: Microsoft
> * Port used: **TCP 3389**
> * Common use: Remotely manage a Windows Server or PC from another device
>
> #### 🧠 What Happens During an RDP Session?
>
> * Your **keyboard/mouse inputs** are sent to the remote machine.
> * The remote machine sends **visual output** (GUI screen) back to your device.
> * It feels like you’re using the remote machine physically.

## Elastic IP

Let’s clearly understand **Elastic IP** in AWS — it’s one of those small but important concepts, especially when hosting web apps like your MERN eCommerce project.

#### 🧠 What is an Elastic IP (EIP)?

> **Elastic IP is a static public IPv4 address** that you can  **attach to your EC2 instance** , so your server's **public IP doesn’t change** — even if you restart or stop the instance.

#### 🤔 Why Do You Need It?

By default:

* Every EC2 instance gets a **public IP** (e.g., `13.233.20.12`)
* But this IP **changes** every time you **stop/start** the instance

That’s a problem if:

* You're using a **domain name**
* Your **frontend app or users** need a consistent backend URL

### ✅ Elastic IP solves this by giving you:

* A **fixed IP address** that **doesn’t change**
* The ability to **reassign it** to another instance if needed

#### 🧱 Real-World Example (Your MERN Project)

### Without Elastic IP:

1. Deploy backend on EC2
2. IP is `13.233.10.10`
3. You stop the instance → IP is now `3.108.11.12`
4. Your frontend breaks, Postman breaks, domain mapping breaks

### With Elastic IP:

1. You associate `54.200.100.123` (EIP) to your EC2
2. Even after stopping/restarting the instance — IP stays the same
3. Frontend, Postman, domain DNS all continue to work

#### 🔁 How It Works

1. You **allocate** an Elastic IP (from AWS pool — it’s free if in use)
2. You **associate** it to your EC2 instance
3. If needed, you can **detach** it and assign to another instance

#### 💸 Cost & Billing

| Case                                  | Charged?                            |
| ------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| EIP**attached**to a running EC2 | ❌ Free                             |
| EIP**not attached**to anything  | ⚠️**Charged**(~$0.005/hour) |

> **✅ Rule of thumb** : Always associate your EIP. If you’re not using it, release it!

## 🔧 How to Allocate & Attach an Elastic IP (from Console)

###### Step 1: Allocate EIP

* Go to **EC2 Dashboard** → Elastic IPs → **Allocate Elastic IP**

###### Step 2: Associate it

* Select the new EIP → Click **Actions > Associate**
* Choose your **Instance** (and optionally a private IP)

---

## Instance type Naming Convention

An EC2 **instance type** defines the **hardware configuration** (CPU, memory, network, etc.) of your virtual server.

Each instance type is made of:

```plaintext
[family][generation].[size]
```

#### 🔤 Format: `family` + `generation` + `size`

#### Example:

```bash
t2.micro
```

* `t` → **Family** (e.g., general purpose)
* `2` → **Generation** (version number of that family)
* `micro` → **Size** (defines CPU/memory)

#### 🔍 EC2 Instance Families (What the Letter Means)

| Letter        | Family Name          | Use Case                                      |
| ------------- | -------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **t**   | General Purpose      | Balanced CPU + RAM (✅ ideal for MERN dev)    |
| **m**   | General Purpose      | More predictable CPU than `t`, better perf. |
| **c**   | Compute Optimized    | High CPU for heavy compute tasks              |
| **r**   | Memory Optimized     | Large RAM (databases, caching)                |
| **g**   | GPU Instances        | Machine learning, graphics, video processing  |
| **i**   | Storage Optimized    | High IOPS (disk I/O)                          |
| **a/z** | ARM-based (Graviton) | Cost-efficient, good for scale                |
| **x**   | Extreme Memory       | SAP, huge DBs                                 |
| **d/h** | Dense Storage        | Big data, Hadoop                              |

#### 🧬 Generation (The Number)

| Number                                                             | Meaning                                          |
| ------------------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| `1`,`2`,`3`,`4`...                                         | Newer = more efficient, better price/performance |
| Example:`t3`is newer than `t2`and often cheaper for more power |                                                  |

#### 📏 Size (The `.micro`, `.small`, `.medium`...)

| Size         | vCPUs | RAM (approx) | Notes                                |
| ------------ | ----- | ------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| `nano`     | 1     | 0.5 GB       | Very tiny — only for testing        |
| `micro`    | 1     | 1 GB         | ✅ Free tier eligible (`t2.micro`) |
| `small`    | 1     | 2 GB         | Slightly better than `micro`       |
| `medium`   | 2     | 4 GB         | Good for light real-world apps       |
| `large`    | 2     | 8 GB         | Can run backend + DB together        |
| `xlarge`   | 4–8  | 16+ GB       | For serious backend workloads        |
| `2xlarge+` | 8+    | 32–512 GB+  | For enterprise needs                 |

#### ✅ Best Types for Your MERN Project

| Use Case                    | Recommended Type           | Notes                          |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Learning + Free Tier        | `t2.micro`,`t3.micro`  | ✅ Free, fine for testing      |
| Lightweight production app  | `t3.small`,`t3.medium` | Cheaper but faster than `t2` |
| Medium traffic + backend/db | `t3.large`,`m5.large`  | Stable                         |
| Heavy sockets / CPU usage   | `c5.large`               | Compute optimized              |
| MongoDB self-hosted         | `r5.large`               | Memory optimized               |

#### 💡 Spot Instances & Savings Plans

If you're doing test deployments, you can use:

* **Spot instances** → up to 90% cheaper (preemptible)
* **Savings plans** or **reserved instances** → cheaper for long term

#### 🧠 Summary

| Term       | Example             | Meaning                    |
| ---------- | ------------------- | -------------------------- |
| Family     | `t`               | General purpose (balanced) |
| Generation | `2`,`3`,`5`   | Version of that family     |
| Size       | `micro`,`large` | Resource level (CPU, RAM)  |

So:

```plaintext
t3.medium = General purpose, 3rd gen, medium size (~2 vCPUs, 4GB RAM)
```

## UserData in EC2

🧠 What Is EC2  **User Data** ?

> **User Data is a script you attach to an EC2 instance that runs automatically on first boot** (when the instance is created).

#### ✅ Use cases:

* Install software (Node.js, Nginx, Mongo client, etc.)
* Clone and start your backend repo
* Set environment variables
* Configure system settings
* Start your server automatically

#### 🛠️ How Does It Work?

When you launch an EC2 instance, you’ll see this optional section:

```
[Advanced Details] → User data (Add script)
```

There, you paste a shell script (Bash).

On first boot, AWS executes it  **as root** , so it can install packages, update the system, etc.

#### 📦 Example: Auto-Install Node.js + Run Express Server

```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install nodejs npm -y
git clone https://github.com/arun/my-backend.git
cd my-backend
npm install
node index.js
```

This will:

* Update the package manager
* Install Node
* Clone your backend repo
* Install dependencies
* Start your server!

## Inbound Rules in EC2

**Inbound rules** in EC2 **control what traffic is allowed *into* your instance** — like who can access your backend, SSH, or frontend.

They are defined in a  **Security Group** , which acts like a virtual firewall.

#### 🧠 Think of It Like This:

* Without inbound rules → 🔒 **your EC2 is invisible** to the outside world
* With proper rules → 🔓 **you allow the right ports in**

#### 🔤 Common Inbound Rules for a MERN App

| Port            | Protocol | Purpose                         | Source                              |
| --------------- | -------- | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------- |
| **22**    | TCP      | SSH (to connect via terminal)   | `My IP`or `0.0.0.0/0`(dev only) |
| **80**    | TCP      | HTTP (for Nginx/React frontend) | `0.0.0.0/0`                       |
| **443**   | TCP      | HTTPS (SSL)                     | `0.0.0.0/0`                       |
| **3000**  | TCP      | React frontend (dev only)       | `0.0.0.0/0`                       |
| **5000**  | TCP      | Express backend (API)           | `0.0.0.0/0`or React IP            |
| **6000+** | TCP      | WebRTC or Socket.io             | Optional, if needed                 |

> `0.0.0.0/0` means  **accessible from anywhere** .
>
> 🔐 For production, use **your IP** or **CloudFront’s IP range** for better security.

#### 📍 How to Add Inbound Rules

1. Go to **EC2 Console**
2. Click **Instances** → Select your instance
3. Under  **Description** , find **Security groups** → click the group
4. Go to **Inbound rules** → Click **Edit inbound rules**
5. Add rules like:

| Type       | Protocol | Port Range | Source    |
| ---------- | -------- | ---------- | --------- |
| SSH        | TCP      | 22         | My IP     |
| HTTP       | TCP      | 80         | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| HTTPS      | TCP      | 443        | 0.0.0.0/0 |
| Custom TCP | TCP      | 5000       | 0.0.0.0/0 |

#### 🚫 What Happens Without Inbound Rules?

* You’ll get:
  * `Connection refused`
  * `Timeout` when visiting the IP
  * Can’t SSH or access your backend
* Your server works locally on EC2 but **is unreachable from outside**

#### 🔐 Security Tip

* Use `My IP` (your actual public IP) instead of `0.0.0.0/0` for **SSH (port 22)**
* For APIs (port 5000), if you only want frontend to access it, **whitelist only the frontend IP/domain**
* For production, use **Nginx (port 80/443)** and reverse proxy

## IAM -  (Identity Access Management)

🛡️ What is AWS IAM?

> **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)** is the **central security service** in AWS that controls  **who can access what** , and  **how** .

It lets you:

* **Create users, groups, and roles**
* **Attach permissions** to control access to AWS services
* **Secure your cloud infrastructure**

**✅ Its just permissions granted to some SERVICES, USERS OR GROUPS**

Let's dive into **AWS IAM (Identity and Access Management)** in full detail — in a way that’s useful for your  **MERN + DevOps goals** , and that helps you  **speak confidently in interviews** .

#### 🔑 Why IAM Is Crucial

Think of IAM as the **security gate** for everything in AWS:

| Without IAM                    | With IAM                                                        |
| ------------------------------ | --------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Everyone can access everything | Only authorized users/resources can access what they're allowed |
| Hard to audit                  | Every action is logged in CloudTrail                            |
| Easy to make costly mistakes   | You can restrict what users and services can do                 |

#### 🔧 IAM Core Components

Let’s break down the  **building blocks** :

##### 1. **IAM Users**

> A user is **a person or a service** that needs to log in or make API requests.

* Used for  **developers, admins** , or scripts
* Each user can have:
  * **Username + password** (for AWS Console login)
  * **Access keys** (for CLI/SDK/API access)
* Example: `arun_admin`, `backend_deploy_bot`

##### 2. **IAM Groups**

> A **group** is a collection of users that share the same permissions.

* Useful for managing teams like:
  * `DevOpsTeam`
  * `FrontendTeam`
  * `QAEngineers`
* You attach **policies** (permissions) to groups

##### 3. **IAM Policies (Permissions)**

> Policies define **what actions are allowed or denied** on  **which resources** .
>
> A policy is an object in AWS that defines permissions.

* Written in **JSON**
* Attached to:
  * Users
  * Groups
  * Roles

#### 🔹 Example Policy: Read-only access to S3

```json
{
  "Effect": "Allow",
  "Action": ["s3:GetObject"],
  "Resource": ["arn:aws:s3:::my-bucket/*"]
}
```

You can also use:

* AWS **Managed Policies** (prebuilt by AWS)
* Or **custom policies** (more fine-tuned)

##### 4. **IAM Roles**

> Roles are like **temporary permission sets** assigned to AWS **resources** or  **trusted entities** .
>
> An  IAM role is an identity you can create that has specific permissions with credentials that are valid for short durations. Roles can be  assumed by entities that you trust.

* Used by:
  * **EC2** (to access S3, DynamoDB, etc.)
  * **Lambda** ,  **ECS** , etc.
  * **Cross-account access**
* Roles have:
  * A **trust policy** (who can assume it)
  * A **permission policy** (what it can do)

🔑 Roles  **do not need passwords or access keys** . AWS handles credentials internally.

##### 5. **IAM Access Keys**

> For **programmatic access** (CLI, SDK, API)

* Format:
  * `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID`
  * `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
* **Avoid using access keys on EC2** — use IAM **roles** instead

#### 🔐 Common Real-World Use Cases (for You)

| Task                               | IAM Setup Needed                        |
| ---------------------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| Upload images from EC2 to S3       | Attach role to EC2 with S3 permissions  |
| Deploy backend with GitHub Actions | Use IAM user with limited access        |
| Allow frontend to call API Gateway | Add `execute-api`permission           |
| Log errors to CloudWatch           | Attach `logs:PutLogEvents`to EC2 role |

#### 📋 IAM Best Practices

| Best Practice                   | Why It Matters                           |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| 🔒 Use**least privilege** | Grant only what’s needed                |
| 👤 No root user for daily work  | Use**IAM users/roles**instead      |
| 🧑‍🤝‍🧑 Use groups           | Easier to manage teams                   |
| 🛑 Rotate access keys regularly | Prevent long-term credential leaks       |
| ✅ Use MFA (Multi-Factor Auth)  | Protect login against breaches           |
| 🚫 Don’t hardcode AWS keys     | Use IAM**roles**on EC2/Lambda etc. |

#### 🔍 How IAM Works Under the Hood

When you make a request to AWS:

1. IAM checks **who** is making the request (user/role)
2. IAM checks **what permissions** they have via policies
3. IAM **allows or denies** the action

✅ IAM is **global** (not region-specific)

#### 📁 IAM in Practice: For Your MERN App

| Component     | IAM Usage                                                             |
| ------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| EC2 Instance  | Attach IAM role to access S3/CloudWatch                               |
| S3 Bucket     | Use bucket policy + IAM permissions                                   |
| GitHub CI/CD  | Create IAM user with `deploy`policy                                 |
| MongoDB Atlas | IAM not needed (external), but good to know when integrating services |

## IAM Roles in EC2

Understanding **IAM roles in EC2** is essential for securely using AWS services like  **S3, CloudWatch, DynamoDB, etc.** ,  **without hardcoding credentials** .

Let’s break it down clearly. 👇

#### 🧠 What is an IAM Role?

> An **IAM Role** is a set of **permissions** (policies) that you can **assign to an AWS resource** like an  **EC2 instance** , so it can access other AWS services  **securely and temporarily** .

#### 📌 Why Use an IAM Role for EC2?

Without a role, your EC2 instance **can’t access** other AWS servsices unless you:

* Manually configure `AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID` and `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY`
* Risk exposing secrets in your `.env` or code (⚠️ Bad Practice)

#### ✅ With a role:

* EC2 gets **temporary credentials** injected automatically
* No need to store secrets
* Fully secure and manageable🧱 Real-Life Examples (Your Use Case)

| Task You Want to Do from EC2     | IAM Role Permissions Needed                    |
| -------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| Upload product images to S3      | `s3:PutObject`,`s3:GetObject`              |
| Log errors to CloudWatch         | `logs:CreateLogStream`,`logs:PutLogEvents` |
| Read config from SSM Param Store | `ssm:GetParameter`                           |
| Write data to DynamoDB           | `dynamodb:PutItem`, etc.                     |

#### 🔐 How IAM Role Works with EC2

1. You **create a role** with the needed permissions
2. You **attach that role** to your EC2 instance
3. EC2 automatically receives **temporary credentials**
4. Your app inside EC2 can access AWS services without needing keys

#### 🛠 How to Create and Attach an IAM Role to EC2

##### Step 1: Go to IAM → Roles → Create Role

* **Trusted entity** : Choose **EC2**
* **Permissions policies** : Select needed ones

  (e.g., `AmazonS3FullAccess`, `CloudWatchAgentServerPolicy`)
* **Role name** : e.g., `FitLabEC2S3Role`

##### Step 2: Attach Role to EC2 Instance

* Go to EC2 → Select your instance
* **Actions** → Security → Modify IAM Role
* Choose `FitLabEC2S3Role` → Save

##### Step 3: Use AWS SDK (No Keys Required)

In Node.js, the SDK will automatically detect the instance role:

```js
const AWS = require('aws-sdk');
const s3 = new AWS.S3();

s3.upload({ Bucket: 'fitlab-bucket', Key: 'image.jpg', Body: fileStream }, ...);
```

No need to configure keys — it just works ✅

#### 🔒 Benefits of IAM Roles

| Benefit                    | Explanation                                                 |
| -------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| 🔐 Secure                  | No hardcoded secrets                                        |
| 🔄 Temporary credentials   | Auto-rotated and short-lived                                |
| 🧼 Cleaner code            | No `.env`AWS keys                                         |
| 📈 Scalable                | Works with autoscaling, Lambda, etc.                        |
| 🧩 Centralized permissions | You can update the role anytime without restarting instance |

#### 💡 Bonus: Attach Role at Launch Time

While creating an EC2 instance, in  **Step 3: Configure Instance** , you can choose a role under  **IAM role** .

#### 🔐 **Use Cases**

Attaching an **IAM role to an EC2 instance** allows the instance to access AWS services securely  **without needing to hard-code credentials** . Here's a real-world example to illustrate this:

##### 📘 Scenario: EC2 Instance Uploading Files to S3

You have a web application running on an **EC2 instance** that processes user-uploaded files and then stores them in an **S3 bucket** for durability and global access.

If you don't want to store AWS access keys directly on the instance (which is insecure), you can **attach an IAM role** with specific permissions to the instance.

##### ✅ Steps and How the Role Helps:

###### 1.  **Create an IAM Role** :

* **Trusted entity** : EC2
* **Permissions policy** : e.g., `AmazonS3FullAccess` (or preferably a custom policy like below)

```json
{
  "Version": "2012-10-17",
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [
        "s3:PutObject",
        "s3:GetObject",
        "s3:ListBucket"
      ],
      "Resource": [
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-app-bucket",
        "arn:aws:s3:::my-app-bucket/*"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

###### 2.  **Attach the Role to the EC2 Instance** :

* When launching the instance, or by modifying the instance settings in the EC2 console later.

###### 3.  **Inside the EC2 Instance** :

Your app (say in Node.js, Python, etc.) can now use AWS SDKs or CLI **without** specifying any credentials.

```bash
aws s3 cp /path/to/file.jpg s3://my-app-bucket/
```

> The EC2 instance will use the **temporary credentials** provided via the IAM role to authenticate the `aws` command.

##### 🔐  **Why This is Important** :

* **No need to store access/secret keys** in code or on disk.
* IAM role credentials are  **automatically rotated** .
* Access is limited based on policies, following  **principle of least privilege** .
* Works with  **CloudWatch** ,  **S3** ,  **DynamoDB** ,  **SSM** , etc.

##### 🧠 Other Common Use Cases:

| ---------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| Logs shipping                | CloudWatch Logs                                          | `logs:PutLogEvents`,`logs:CreateLogStream`         |
| Auto scaling lifecycle hooks | Auto Scaling, Lambda                                     | Depends on hook                                        |
| App config fetch             | Systems Manager (SSM) Parameter Store or Secrets Manager | `ssm:GetParameter`,`secretsmanager:GetSecretValue` |
| Monitoring                   | CloudWatch Agent                                         | `cloudwatch:PutMetricData`                           |

## AWS Security Groups and ICMP (Ping Testing)

#### 🔐 What Is a Security Group?

> A **Security Group (SG)** is a virtual **firewall** for your EC2 instance that  **controls inbound and outbound traffic** .

* **Inbound rules** : Who can connect **to** your EC2 (e.g., SSH, HTTP, etc.)
* **Outbound rules** : Where your EC2 can connect **out to** (e.g., APIs, internet, DB)

✅ Think of it like:

> “Only allow port 22 (SSH) from my laptop”
>
> “Only allow HTTP traffic on port 80 from anywhere”

#### 🧪 What is ICMP and Why Test with It?

> **ICMP** is the protocol used for **pinging** an instance to check connectivity.

So when you do:

```bash
ping <IP address>
```

Your computer sends  **ICMP Echo Requests** , and expects an  **Echo Reply** .

This is useful when:

* You want to check if 2 EC2 instances can talk to each other
* You're debugging network/firewall issues between machines

#### 🛠 How to Allow ICMP in a Security Group

##### Step-by-Step:

1. Go to **EC2 Console**
2. Click **Security Groups** on the left sidebar
3. Choose the security group of your EC2 instance
4. Click **Edit Inbound Rules**
5. Click **Add Rule**
   * Type: `All ICMP - IPv4`
   * Protocol: `ICMP`
   * Port Range: (auto-filled)
   * Source: Choose `Anywhere (0.0.0.0/0)` or a specific security group
6. Click **Save Rules**

✅ Now the instance can **receive ping requests**

#### 📦 Real Use Case: Ping Between Two EC2 Instances

Let’s say you launched:

* `EC2-A` with IP `172.31.1.10` in `SecurityGroup-A`
* `EC2-B` with IP `172.31.1.20` in `SecurityGroup-B`

To test if `EC2-A` can ping `EC2-B`:

###### 1. **Add inbound ICMP rule to SecurityGroup-B:**

* Type: `All ICMP - IPv4`
* Source: `SecurityGroup-A`

  (Means: only EC2-A can ping EC2-B)

## **Access EC2 Instance Metadata**

🧠 What Is EC2 Instance Metadata?

> **Instance Metadata** is  **information about your EC2 instance** , made available  **from inside the instance** , without using the AWS Console or CLI.

You can access this data using **HTTP requests** from within the instance itself —  **no authentication needed** .

#### 🌐 Access URL

To access metadata from your EC2 instance:

```bash
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
```

This IP (`169.254.169.254`) is **reserved by AWS** to expose **local metadata** from within EC2 instances.

#### 📦 What Kind of Data Can You Get?

| Metadata Type     | Example Value / Path                              |
| ----------------- | ------------------------------------------------- |
| Instance ID       | `/latest/meta-data/instance-id`                 |
| AMI ID            | `/latest/meta-data/ami-id`                      |
| Public IPv4       | `/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4`                 |
| Private IP        | `/latest/meta-data/local-ipv4`                  |
| Hostname          | `/latest/meta-data/hostname`                    |
| Availability Zone | `/latest/meta-data/placement/availability-zone` |
| IAM Role attached | `/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/`   |
| User Data         | `/latest/user-data`                             |

#### 🔧 Common Commands

##### Get instance ID

```bash
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/instance-id
```

##### Get public IP

```bash
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/public-ipv4
```

##### Get IAM role name (if any)

```bash
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/
```

##### Get entire IAM role credentials (⚠️ for scripts, not sharing)

```bash
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/iam/security-credentials/YourRoleName
```

##### Get the full metadata tree

```bash
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/ -s | sort
```

#### 🛠 Real-World Use Cases

| Use Case                        | Why Metadata Helps                               |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Auto-tagging EC2s via script    | Grab instance ID, then use it in tagging API     |
| Automate region-aware configs   | Get region/zone dynamically                      |
| Access IAM credentials securely | No need for hardcoded access keys                |
| Debug why an EC2 isn't behaving | Verify instance details (role, IP, region, etc.) |
| Use in User Data scripts        | Pull data at runtime like IP, zone, etc.         |

#### 🔐 Security Note

* This metadata service is **internal to the instance only**
* External users **cannot** access it
* AWS added **v2 metadata** with token-based protection (for extra security)

#### ⚙️ EC2 Metadata Service Versions

| Version      | Access Method               | Notes                   |
| ------------ | --------------------------- | ----------------------- |
| **v1** | Just curl the IP            | Older, still supported  |
| **v2** | Requires a token for access | More secure (preferred) |

**Example (v2):**

```bash
TOKEN=$(curl -X PUT "http://169.254.169.254/latest/api/token" \
  -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token-ttl-seconds: 21600")

curl -H "X-aws-ec2-metadata-token: $TOKEN" \
  http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data/
```

#### Or Install ec2-metadata

🔧 What is `ec2-metadata`?

> The `ec2-metadata` tool is a **CLI utility** provided by AWS that simplifies **retrieving metadata** from within an EC2 instance.

Instead of using long `curl` commands to fetch data from `http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data`, you can just type simple commands like:

```bash
ec2-metadata -i     # get instance ID
ec2-metadata -p     # get public IP
```

🔍 Why Use It?

✅ **Cleaner syntax**

✅ **Faster debugging**

✅ **Supports multiple metadata types**

✅ Helpful in  **init scripts** ,  **user-data** , and **diagnostics**

⚙️ How to Install It

If it's not pre-installed on your EC2 Linux instance:

```bash
sudo yum install -y ec2-instance-connect   # Amazon Linux
```

Or on Ubuntu:

```bash
sudo apt install -y cloud-utils
```

On Ubuntu/Debian-based EC2s, the tool might be installed as:

```bash
ec2metadata  # note: no dash!
```

📋 Common Commands

| Command             | Output               |

## **Accessing EC2 Instance User Data**

#### 🧠 What Is EC2 User Data?

> **User Data** is a script (usually a shell script) you pass to an EC2 instance **during launch** that runs **automatically the first time** the instance boots.

It's used for:

* Installing packages (Node.js, MongoDB, etc.)
* Cloning your GitHub repo
* Starting your backend
* Setting up environment variables
* Automating server setup (no manual SSH needed)

🟢 **One-time auto-configuration when the instance starts.**

#### 🛠 Example User Data Script

```bash
#!/bin/bash
sudo apt update -y
sudo apt install nodejs npm -y
git clone https://github.com/arun/fitlab-backend.git
cd fitlab-backend
npm install
npm start
```

This will:

* Update the system
* Install Node.js
* Clone your repo
* Install dependencies
* Start the server

#### 🌐 Where to Add User Data?

When launching an EC2 instance via the AWS Console:

1. Go to **Step 3: Configure Instance Details**
2. Scroll to **Advanced Details**
3. In  **User data** , paste your shell script
4. Launch the instance

#### 👀 How to Access User Data *After* Launch

Once the EC2 is running, you can check what script it received.

##### ✅ From inside the instance (Linux):

```bash
curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data
```

This command:

* Contacts the **instance metadata service**
* Returns the exact user-data script used during launch

> ⚠️ Note: This only works  **if user-data was set** , and hasn't been cleared.

#### 🔁 Re-running User Data (Optional)

By default, **user data runs only once** — during the first boot.

To make it re-run on every boot:

* You must modify the script to be re-entrant
* Or configure cloud-init to allow that (advanced)

#### 🧠 Why It Matters (Your Use Case)

For your **FitLab MERN eCommerce** backend:

* You can spin up an EC2 and **have it auto-deploy your backend**
* No manual SSH or setup needed
* Makes you look **very professional in interviews**
* Teaches you basics of **DevOps & automation**

#### 🔒 Tip for Debugging

You can see logs of user-data execution in:

```bash
cat /var/log/cloud-init-output.log
```

It shows:

* If installation commands succeeded or failed
* Any errors during first boot

## ✅ Summary

| Topic                        | Explanation                                         |
| ---------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **User Data**          | Script passed to EC2 on launch to run at first boot |
| **Used for**           | Auto-installing packages, setting up servers        |
| **Access it from EC2** | `curl http://169.254.169.254/latest/user-data`    |
| **Debug logs**         | `/var/log/cloud-init-output.log`                  |
| **Runs only once?**    | Yes, unless configured otherwise                    |

## **EC2 Status Checks and Monitoring**

This is crucial for ensuring your EC2 instance is  **healthy** , especially when it's running important services like your  **MERN backend, WebRTC, or real-time sockets** .

#### 🔍 What Are EC2 Status Checks?

When an EC2 instance runs, AWS automatically performs  **two types of health checks** :

| Type                            | What It Checks                                                                  | Who Is Responsible       |
| ------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| **System Status Check**   | Underlying AWS infrastructure (host hardware, power, network)                   | ✅ AWS’s responsibility |
| **Instance Status Check** | Issues**inside your OS**(e.g., high CPU, disk full, networking misconfig) | ✅ Your responsibility   |

#### 🛠 Where to View Status Checks?

1. Go to the **EC2 Dashboard**
2. Click on your **Instance**
3. In the  **"Status check" tab** , you'll see:

```
✔ 2/2 checks passed
```

Or

```
⚠ 1/2 checks passed (e.g., Instance check failed)
```

#### 🔄 How Often Are They Run?

* AWS runs both status checks **every minute**
* If they fail, they’re **automatically retried** for some time
* AWS can reboot or stop the instance if you’ve set **recovery actions**

#### 🚑 Common Failure Scenarios

| Issue Type         | What Fails     | Example Cause                        |
| ------------------ | -------------- | ------------------------------------ |
| AWS hardware issue | System check   | Host failure, power/network loss     |
| App/server crashed | Instance check | Node.js crashed, OOM, wrong firewall |
| Disk full          | Instance check | App generated logs without rotation  |
| Boot issue         | Instance check | Bad user-data script broke boot      |

## 📈 EC2 Monitoring (CloudWatch)

EC2 sends **basic monitoring metrics** to  **Amazon CloudWatch** :

| Metric              | What it shows            |
| ------------------- | ------------------------ |
| CPU Utilization     | Backend overloaded?      |
| Disk I/O            | Uploads/downloads heavy? |
| Network In/Out      | Socket traffic usage     |
| Status Check Failed | System or instance issue |

#### 🔧 Recovery & Actions

You can set **CloudWatch alarms** to:

* Auto-reboot instance if checks fail
* Notify via SNS/email
* Trigger auto-scaling actions (advanced)

#### Example

![1751111309700](image/Hosting/1751111309700.png)

![1751111318792](image/Hosting/1751111318792.png)

![1751111383205](image/Hosting/1751111383205.png)

#### ✅ Summary

| Concept                         | Details                      |
| ------------------------------- | ---------------------------- |
| **System Status Check**   | AWS hardware/network check   |
| **Instance Status Check** | Your OS/app-level issue      |
| **2/2 checks passed**     | Instance is healthy          |
| **Monitored in**          | EC2 Console and CloudWatch   |
| **Alerts/Recovery**       | Set up via CloudWatch alarms |

#### 🔥 For Your Project (FitLab MERN App):

You can:

* Use EC2 status checks to detect crashes automatically
* Reboot or replace failing instances
* Add CloudWatch alarms (e.g., alert if CPU > 80%)

## Public vs Private vs Elastic IP Addresses

#### 📦 Quick Definitions

| Type                 | Definition                                                                      |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Private IP** | Internal IP used**within AWS (VPC)**— not accessible from the internet   |
| **Public IP**  | External IP**temporarily**assigned by AWS to access EC2 from the internet |
| **Elastic IP** | A**permanent public IP**you can assign to an EC2 (even after reboot/stop) |

#### 🌐 1. **Private IP**

> Internal IP used for communication  **within the VPC (AWS's private network)** .

Characteristics:

* Looks like `172.31.x.x` (default VPC range)
* Assigned when EC2 launches
* Doesn't change unless you terminate the instance
* Used to connect between EC2s, RDS, etc.
* **Not reachable from the internet**

🧠 Example: Your backend EC2 talks to MongoDB (in private subnet) using **Private IP**

#### 🌍 2. **Public IP**

> Temporary IP assigned by AWS for internet access when instance is launched in a  **public subnet** .

Characteristics:

* Looks like: `13.235.12.91`, etc.
* Allows HTTP access (`http://public-ip`)
* **Changes every time** you stop/start the EC2
* Automatically assigned only if you:
  * Put EC2 in public subnet
  * Enable “Auto-assign Public IP: Yes” during launch

🧠 Example: You're testing your backend or React app — you access it via the public IP

#### 📌 3. **Elastic IP**

> A **static public IP** you can attach to an EC2 and it  **won’t change** , even if the instance is stopped, restarted, or replaced.

Characteristics:

* Allocated manually from AWS pool
* Remains yours until you release it
* Can be **re-attached to other EC2s**
* Useful for production — **consistent endpoint**
* You get  **1 free Elastic IP** , but AWS **charges** if:
  * It's **unattached**
  * Or you have more than 1

🧠 Example: Deploying your **FitLab backend in production** — assign an Elastic IP and connect your domain to it (`api.fitlab.in` → Elastic IP)

| Free?                    | ✅ Always           | ✅ Always               | ✅ 1 free (billed if unused) |
| Use case                 | Internal networking | Temporary public access | Permanent public access      |

#### 🔧 Typical Setup for MERN App

| Component               | IP Type                  | Reason                            |
| ----------------------- | ------------------------ | --------------------------------- |
| React Frontend (S3/EC2) | Public or Elastic        | So users can visit your site      |
| Node/Express Backend    | Public or Elastic        | Needed if frontend calls backend  |
| MongoDB (Atlas)         | External                 | Atlas handles IP for you          |
| MongoDB (Self-hosted)   | Private IP + NAT/Bastion | For secure access only within VPC |

---

## **Private IP Addresses in EC2 (AWS)**

#### 🧠 What Is a Private IP?

> A **private IP address** is an internal IP address  **used inside a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC)** . It allows AWS resources (like EC2 instances) to  **communicate privately with each other** ,  **without going over the public internet** .

#### 🧭 Where Do You See Private IPs?

* Every EC2 instance in AWS gets **at least one Private IP** when launched.
* Looks like this:
  * `172.31.23.45` (Default VPC range)
  * `10.0.1.5` or `192.168.x.x` in custom VPCs

You can view it in the  **EC2 Console → Instances → Private IP address** .

#### 💡 Why Use Private IPs?

✅ For Internal Communication

* EC2 to EC2 (e.g., backend talking to DB)
* EC2 to RDS (your MongoDB/Postgres hosted in private subnet)
* Application tiers communicating securely

✅ Saves Cost

* No need for NAT or internet routing
* Private data stays internal, **reducing exposure**

✅ Security Best Practice

* Don’t expose databases, backend admin panels, etc. to public internet
* Use **private subnets** + **bastion hosts** if needed

#### 🧱 Practical Example (FitLab MERN App)

Let’s say you have:

* `EC2-Frontend`: Runs React app (public subnet)
* `EC2-Backend`: Node.js/Express API (private subnet)
* `MongoDB EC2`: DB server (private subnet)

These all use **private IPs** to talk to each other:

```bash
React → API via Public IP (or API Gateway)
API → DB via Private IP (172.31.x.x)
```

If your backend and DB are in  **same VPC** , private IP is all you need.

#### 🔧 How to Use Private IPs

##### Inside EC2 (Linux):

```bash
hostname -I
# or
ip a
# or check in AWS console
```

Use that IP in your app configs:

```js
mongoose.connect("mongodb://172.31.22.5:27017/mydb")
```

##### From One EC2 to Another:

```bash
ping 172.31.1.9
curl http://172.31.1.9:3000/api/products
```

✅ No internet required, if they're in same VPC and security groups allow it.

#### ❗Things to Keep in Mind

| Limitation                         | Fix                            |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------------ |
| Can't access from outside AWS      | Use public or elastic IP       |
| Might be blocked by security group | Add correct inbound rules      |
| DNS doesn't work unless configured | Use private DNS (via Route 53) |

#### 🧠 Summary

| Feature             | Description                                |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| What it is          | Internal-only IP for EC2 inside a VPC      |
| Format              | `172.x.x.x`,`10.x.x.x`,`192.168.x.x` |
| Accessible from     | EC2s in same VPC or peered VPCs            |
| Publicly reachable? | ❌ No                                      |
| Common use          | Backend <-> DB, app-tier <-> cache         |

---

## Elastic Network Interface (ENI)

✅ **What Is It?**

An **ENI** is a **virtual network interface** that you can attach to an EC2 instance.

It contains:

* A **primary private IP address**
* One or more **secondary private IPs**
* A **public IP** (or Elastic IP)
* MAC address
* Security groups

### 🔧 **Use Case**

* Move an IP configuration from one EC2 to another (failover)
* Use multiple NICs for complex networking setups (e.g., firewalls, dual-subnet apps)
* Assign multiple private IPs to a single instance

### 🧠 Example:

Suppose you're building a failover system.

If your EC2 crashes, you can **detach the ENI** and  **re-attach it to a backup instance** , and traffic resumes instantly without DNS changes.

### 💡 Key Points:

| Feature                       | Description                                   |
| ----------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| **Attach/Detach**       | Can attach ENIs to instances in the same AZ   |
| **Multiple ENIs**       | Instances can have more than one ENI          |
| **Backup and failover** | Used in high availability systems             |
| **Primary ENI**         | Created automatically when an EC2 is launched |
| **Secondary ENIs**      | You can create more via the console or API    |

### 🔁 **EIP vs ENI – Key Differences**

| Feature  | Elastic IP                     | Elastic Network Interface          |
| -------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------- |
| Type     | IP address                     | Virtual network interface          |
| Scope    | Public Internet Access         | Internal VPC communication + more  |
| Use Case | Fixed public IP                | Advanced networking, failover      |
| Movement | Can be reassigned between EC2s | Can be attached/detached from EC2s |

### ✅ Quick Summary:

| Concept              | Description                                         |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| **Elastic IP** | Static public IP for EC2                            |
| **ENI**        | Virtual network card with IPs and security settings |

## ----NVM (Node Version Manager)

💻 What is NVM?

**NVM (Node Version Manager)** is a **tool used to manage multiple versions of Node.js** on a single machine.

> Think of it as a version switcher for Node.js — useful when you work on different projects that require different Node versions.

#### ✅ Why Use NVM?

* Install and use **multiple versions** of Node.js easily.
* **Switch** between Node versions per project.
* **Test** your app across different Node.js versions.
* No need to use `sudo` or mess with system-wide Node installation.

#### 🔧 Key Features

| Feature                   | Description                     |
| ------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| 📦 Install Node versions  | `nvm install <version>`       |
| 🔁 Switch Node versions   | `nvm use <version>`           |
| 🧪 Set default version    | `nvm alias default <version>` |
| 🗑️ Remove versions      | `nvm uninstall <version>`     |
| 🔍 See installed versions | `nvm ls`                      |

#### 🛠️ How to Install NVM

On  **Linux/macOS** :

1. Open terminal and run:
   ```bash
   curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.39.7/install.sh | bash
   ```
2. Restart terminal or run:
   ```bash
   source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
   ```
3. Verify:
   ```bash
   nvm --version
   ```

#### 🚀 Common NVM Commands

| Task                        | Command                  |
| --------------------------- | ------------------------ |
| Install Node.js v18         | `nvm install 18`       |
| Use Node.js v16             | `nvm use 16`           |
| Show all installed versions | `nvm ls`               |
| List all available versions | `nvm ls-remote`        |
| Set Node.js v18 as default  | `nvm alias default 18` |
| Uninstall Node.js v16       | `nvm uninstall 16`     |
| Check current Node version  | `node -v`              |

#### 📦 NVM for Windows?

* Windows doesn’t support the standard `nvm` natively.
* Use: [**nvm-windows**](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)

#### Install (for Windows):

1. Download from: [https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases)
2. Install and use via Command Prompt or PowerShell:
   ```bash
   nvm install 18.16.0
   nvm use 18.16.0
   ```

#### 🧠 Example Workflow

```bash
nvm install 18
nvm install 16

nvm use 18         # Uses Node.js v18
node -v            # Prints v18.x.x

nvm use 16         # Switches to Node.js v16
node -v            # Prints v16.x.x
```

#### 🧼 Tip:

Each version of Node.js you install via NVM has  **its own `npm`** , so packages are kept separate per version.

#### 🔧 **Complete List of Useful `nvm` Commands**

Yes! In addition to the commonly used commands, **NVM (Node Version Manager)** has several more commands and options that are helpful for managing Node.js versions more effectively.

##### 📥 **Installing Node**

## ----Deploying Node Application in EC2

#### Step 1: Install NodeJS and NPM using nvm

[](https://github.com/yeshwanthlm/nodejs-on-ec2?tab=readme-ov-file#step-1-install-nodejs-and-npm-using-nvm)

Install node version manager (nvm) by typing the following at the command line.

```shell
sudo su -
curl -o- https://raw.githubusercontent.com/nvm-sh/nvm/v0.34.0/install.sh | bash
```

Activate nvm by typing the following at the command line.

```shell
. ~/.nvm/nvm.sh   # OR source ~/.nvm/nvm.sh  
```

> The command:
>
> ```bash
> . ~/.nvm/nvm.sh
> ```
>
> means:
>
> **✅ What it does:**
>
> This **loads the `nvm` (Node Version Manager) script** into your current shell session.
>
> **🔍 Breakdown:**
>
> * `.` (dot) is shorthand for the `source` command in bash. It  **executes a script in the current shell** , not a new one.
> * `~/.nvm/nvm.sh` is the **path to the main script** of `nvm`, typically located in the user's home directory.
>
> So this command tells your shell:
>
>> "Run the `nvm.sh` script from the `.nvm` directory so I can use `nvm` commands like `nvm install`, `nvm use`, etc."
>>
>
> **🧠 Why you need this:**
>
> If `nvm` isn't already loaded (like in some login shells or scripts), running this command manually makes `nvm` available  **without restarting the terminal** .
>
> ##### 🔄 Alternative:
>
> You can also add this line to your shell config file (`~/.bashrc`, `~/.zshrc`, etc.) to auto-load `nvm` every time a new shell session starts.
>
> ```bash
> export NVM_DIR="$HOME/.nvm"
> [ -s "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh" ] && \. "$NVM_DIR/nvm.sh"
> ```
>
>

Use nvm to install the latest version of Node.js by typing the following at the command line.

```shell
nvm install node
```

Test that node and npm are installed and running correctly by typing the following at the terminal:

```shell
node -v
npm -v
```

#### Step 2: Install Git and clone repository from GitHub

[](https://github.com/yeshwanthlm/nodejs-on-ec2?tab=readme-ov-file#step-2-install-git-and-clone-repository-from-github)

To install git, run below commands in the terminal window:

# --------------NGNIX-----------------------

## ----Introduction

Nginx (pronounced "engine-x") is a **high-performance, open-source web server** and **reverse proxy** server. Originally designed for handling high concurrency, it's now widely used in modern web architectures for  **serving static content** ,  **load balancing** ,  **reverse proxying** ,  **SSL termination** , and more.

#### 🔍 **What Is Nginx Exactly?**

Nginx is a **web server software** that can:

* Serve **static files** (like HTML, CSS, JS, images)
* Act as a **reverse proxy** (forward client requests to other servers like Node.js)
* Handle **HTTPS/SSL termination**
* Perform **load balancing**
* Function as a  **mail proxy** ,  **API gateway** , or **content cache**

It's known for:

* **Asynchronous** , **event-driven architecture** (more efficient than Apache for concurrency)
* Very **low memory usage**
* **High scalability and speed**

#### 🧠 **Key Concepts**

##### 1. **Web Server**

* Serves static files directly (HTML, JS, images).
* E.g., A static website hosted on EC2 or S3 behind Nginx.

##### 2. **Reverse Proxy**

* Receives requests from the client and **forwards them to another server** (e.g., a Node.js backend running on `localhost:3000`).
* Hides internal architecture from the outside world.
* Useful for  **security, load distribution, and HTTPS handling** .

##### 3. **Load Balancer**

* Distributes incoming traffic to multiple backend servers.
* Used for  **horizontal scaling** .

##### 4. **SSL/TLS Termination**

* Nginx can handle HTTPS connections using certificates (via Let’s Encrypt or AWS ACM).
* It decrypts SSL traffic and forwards plain HTTP traffic to internal servers.

#### ✨ **Features of Nginx**

| Feature                | Description                                                    |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ High performance    | Handles thousands of concurrent connections efficiently        |
| ✅ Reverse proxy       | Forwards requests to backend servers like Node.js, Python, PHP |
| ✅ Load balancing      | Supports round-robin, IP-hash, and least-connected algorithms  |
| ✅ Static file serving | Fast, direct delivery of HTML, CSS, JS, images                 |
| ✅ TLS/SSL             | Easily handles HTTPS using Certbot or other tools              |
| ✅ Gzip compression    | Reduces response size for faster client delivery               |
| ✅ Caching             | Static and dynamic content caching options                     |
| ✅ Security features   | Rate limiting, request filtering, header control               |
| ✅ Logging             | Access logs and error logs for analytics/debugging             |
| ✅ Virtual Hosts       | Host multiple domains/subdomains on the same server            |

#### 💡 **Common Use Cases / Scenarios**

##### 1. **Serve a Node.js Backend**

* Your Express app runs on port 3000
* Nginx listens on port 80 and proxies traffic to `localhost:3000`

##### 2. **Host a React Frontend**

* Build the React app → Upload to `/var/www/html`
* Nginx serves the `index.html`, CSS, and JS files

##### 3. **Combine Both**

* Serve React frontend (on `/`)
* Proxy API requests (e.g., `/api`) to Node.js backend

##### 4. **Use with SSL/HTTPS**

* Set up Let's Encrypt with Nginx to secure your site with HTTPS
* All requests go through HTTPS via Nginx, keeping your backend HTTP

##### 5. **Host Multiple Sites**

* Use `server_name` and `listen` directives to serve multiple apps or domains from one EC2

#### 🛠️ **Typical Configuration Examples**

##### 🌐 Serve Static Frontend:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    root /var/www/html;
    index index.html;

    location / {
        try_files $uri $uri/ =404;
    }
}
```

##### 🔁 Reverse Proxy to Node.js Backend:

```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name api.yourdomain.com;

    location / {
        proxy_pass http://localhost:3000;
        proxy_http_version 1.1;
        proxy_set_header Host $host;
        proxy_set_header X-Real-IP $remote_addr;
    }
}
```

##### 🔒 HTTPS Setup (with Certbot)

```nginx
server {
    listen 443 ssl;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    ssl_certificate /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/fullchain.pem;
    ssl_certificate_key /etc/letsencrypt/live/yourdomain.com/privkey.pem;

    location / {
        root /var/www/html;
        index index.html;
    }
}
```

## ----Nginx vs Traditional Web Servers

✅ **What is a traditional web server?**

Traditional web servers, like  **Apache HTTP Server** , were designed primarily to serve web content using the  **process/thread-per-connection model** . For every request or connection, a new thread or process is created to handle it.

#### ✅ **Nginx vs Traditional Web Servers (like Apache)**

| Feature / Aspect                  | **Nginx**                                                         | **Apache (Traditional Web Server)**                                     |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Architecture**            | Event-driven, asynchronous, non-blocking                                | Process- or thread-based, blocking                                            |
| **Performance under Load**  | Handles thousands of concurrent connections efficiently                 | Struggles as connections increase due to process/thread overhead              |
| **Static Content Handling** | Extremely fast and efficient                                            | Slower compared to Nginx                                                      |
| **Dynamic Content**         | Relies on external processors (e.g., PHP-FPM)                           | Built-in (mod_php or other modules)                                           |
| **Configuration**           | Declarative, concise, fast reloads                                      | Verbose, flexible, but slower reloads                                         |
| **Reverse Proxy Support**   | First-class support, highly performant                                  | Available but not the primary focus                                           |
| **Memory Usage**            | Very low even with many connections                                     | High when many threads/processes are active                                   |
| **Security**                | Smaller attack surface due to fewer modules                             | More features = larger surface for vulnerabilities                            |
| **Use Case Preference**     | Best for high concurrency, reverse proxy, load balancing, microservices | Useful when extensive module support and in-process dynamic content is needed |

#### ✅ **Nginx is typically preferred when:**

* You need to serve **static files (HTML, JS, CSS, images)** at high speed.
* You're acting as a **reverse proxy** or **load balancer** for backend servers.
* Your application must handle  **tens of thousands of concurrent users** .
* You're using **microservices** or  **containerized services** .
* You want an **API gateway** for routing requests efficiently.

---

### ✅ **Apache is better suited when:**

* You have legacy applications that rely heavily on **.htaccess** files.
* You're running **PHP-heavy** apps (though Nginx + PHP-FPM is better today).
* You need specific modules only available in Apache.

---

### ✅ **Summary**

* **Nginx = Lightweight, high performance, ideal for modern web apps.**
* **Apache = Versatile and feature-rich, but heavier and less performant at scale.**

For your learning path (since you’re working with EC2, PM2, and deploying apps), **Nginx is an essential modern skill** for:

* Serving frontend files
* Reverse proxying Node apps
* SSL termination
* Load balancing
