The `URL.createObjectURL()` method is used to create a DOMString representing a URL for the given object or file. It is commonly used to generate a URL for objects like `File` or `Blob` objects, which can then be used as the `src` attribute value of HTML elements such as `<img>`, `<video>`, or `<audio>` to display or play the content.

Here's the syntax:

```javascript
const url = URL.createObjectURL(object);
```

- `object`: The object for which to create a URL. This can be a `File` object, a `Blob` object, or other objects that support the `URL.createObjectURL()` interface.

The method returns a DOMString representing the created URL. This URL represents the object in memory and can be used until it is revoked or the page is unloaded.

Here's an example of using `URL.createObjectURL()` with an image file:

```javascript
// Assuming `file` is a File object representing an image file
const url = URL.createObjectURL(file);

// Create an image element and set its src attribute to the generated URL
const img = document.createElement('img');
img.src = url;

// Append the image element to the document body to display the image
document.body.appendChild(img);
```

In this example, the `URL.createObjectURL()` method is used to create a URL for the `file` object representing an image file. Then, an `<img>` element is created and its `src` attribute is set to the generated URL. Finally, the image element is appended to the document body, displaying the image.

Remember to call `URL.revokeObjectURL()` to release the resources associated with the created URL once it is no longer needed, to avoid memory leaks:

```javascript
URL.revokeObjectURL(url);
```

This should be done when the URL is no longer needed, such as when the image element is removed from the DOM or when the page is unloaded.
