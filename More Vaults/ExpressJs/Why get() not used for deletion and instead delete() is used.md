--HTTP defines different methods for different purposes, and each method has its own semantics. ---While it's technically possible to use `GET` requests to perform deletion operations, it's not recommended or considered good practice. 
--This is because it violates the principles of HTTP and the expectations associated with each HTTP method. 
Here are some reasons why you should use `DELETE` instead of `GET` for deletion:

1. **Idempotence:**
   - The HTTP methods have a concept of idempotence, where an operation can be repeated multiple times with the same result. `GET` is idempotent, meaning that making the same `GET` request multiple times should have the same effect.
   - Deletion is not inherently idempotent. If you use `GET` for deletion, multiple requests might unintentionally delete the resource multiple times.

2. **Caching and Visibility:**
   - `GET` requests are often cached by browsers and intermediaries. If a `GET` request is used for deletion, intermediaries may cache the request, leading to unintended deletion of the resource for subsequent users.
   - Additionally, using `GET` for deletion may expose sensitive information in URLs, as URLs are often logged by web servers and browsers.

3. **Semantic Clarity:**
   - HTTP methods are designed to have clear and standardized semantics. `DELETE` is the standard method for indicating that a resource should be deleted, making your API more predictable and easier to understand for developers.

4. **Security Considerations:**
   - Using `GET` for deletion can have security implications, especially if sensitive data or operations are involved. For example, a malicious user might trick someone into clicking a link that performs a deletion.

5. **RESTful Principles:**
   - RESTful principles encourage the use of HTTP methods in a way that aligns with their intended semantics. `DELETE` is the appropriate method for resource deletion.
