In Express.js, the `app.all()` method is a routing method that is used to handle all HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) for a specific route. It is similar to `app.use()`, but it specifically matches all HTTP methods rather than being method-agnostic. This can be useful when you want to define middleware or route handlers that should apply to a particular route regardless of the HTTP method used in the request.

Here's a basic example:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// Middleware function that applies to all HTTP methods for the '/example' route
app.all('/example', (req, res, next) => {
  console.log('Middleware for all HTTP methods');
  next(); // Pass control to the next middleware or route handler
});

// Route handler for all HTTP methods for the '/example' route
app.all('/example', (req, res) => {
  console.log('Route handler for all HTTP methods');
  res.send('Response from the route handler');
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

In this example:

- The `app.all('/example', ...)` middleware function and route handler are triggered for any HTTP method (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.) used with the `/example` route.

- The middleware function logs a message to the console and then calls `next()` to pass control to the next middleware or route handler in the chain.

- The route handler logs another message to the console and sends a response.

Keep in mind that `app.all()` is generally used for scenarios where you want to apply the same logic or middleware to all HTTP methods for a specific route. If you want to handle specific HTTP methods separately, you can use method-specific routing methods like `app.get()`, `app.post()`, etc.

It's worth noting that the order in which you define route handlers and middleware matters. The first matching route or middleware will be executed. Therefore, if you have multiple route handlers for the same route and HTTP method, the order of their definitions matters.
