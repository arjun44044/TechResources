Single Purpose Aggregation in MongoDB refers to using the aggregation pipeline to perform a specific, targeted operation with a well-defined goal. Instead of creating a general-purpose aggregation pipeline that handles multiple tasks, a single-purpose aggregation pipeline focuses on a particular use case, often optimizing performance and readability.

Here are some examples of single-purpose aggregations:

1. **Group and Sum:**
   - Use the aggregation pipeline to group documents by a certain field and calculate the sum of another field within each group.

   ```javascript
   db.sales.aggregate([
     { $group: { _id: "$product", totalSales: { $sum: "$quantity" } } }
   ]);
   ```

   This pipeline groups sales by product and calculates the total quantity sold for each product.

2. **Filter and Project:**
   - Use the aggregation pipeline to filter documents based on a condition and project only the required fields.

   ```javascript
   db.orders.aggregate([
     { $match: { status: "completed" } },
     { $project: { _id: 0, orderId: "$_id", totalAmount: "$amount" } }
   ]);
   ```

   This pipeline filters orders with a specific status and projects a subset of fields.

3. **Sort and Limit:**
   - Use the aggregation pipeline to sort documents and limit the result set.

   ```javascript
   db.logEntries.aggregate([
     { $sort: { timestamp: -1 } },
     { $limit: 10 }
   ]);
   ```

   This pipeline sorts log entries by timestamp in descending order and limits the result to the latest 10 entries.

4. **Unwind Arrays:**
   - Use the `$unwind` stage to deconstruct arrays and perform operations on individual array elements.

   ```javascript
   db.blogPosts.aggregate([
     { $unwind: "$tags" },
     { $group: { _id: "$tags", count: { $sum: 1 } } }
   ]);
   ```

   This pipeline unwinds the `tags` array in blog posts and counts the occurrences of each tag.

The key idea is to design aggregation pipelines that address specific requirements, making them concise, easy to understand, and efficient. Single-purpose aggregations are particularly useful when dealing with large datasets and complex queries, as they allow for better optimization and maintainability.

It's worth noting that MongoDB supports multiple aggregation stages, and you can chain them together to create powerful pipelines tailored to your specific use cases.
