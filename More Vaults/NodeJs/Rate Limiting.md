Rate limiting in Node.js is a technique used to control the rate at which incoming requests are handled by a server. It is a crucial part of securing web applications, preventing abuse, and ensuring fair resource allocation. There are several strategies for implementing rate limiting in Node.js, and I'll outline a few common approaches.
### 1. **Basic Token Bucket Algorithm:**
### 2. **Express Rate Limit Middleware:**

- For Node.js applications built using the Express.js framework, the `express-rate-limit` middleware provides a convenient way to implement rate limiting.

javascript

```javascript
const rateLimit = require('express-rate-limit');

const limiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 60 * 1000, // 1 minute
  max: 10, // limit each IP to 10 requests per windowMs
});

// Apply rate limiting middleware to specific routes or all routes
app.use('/api/', limiter);
```
