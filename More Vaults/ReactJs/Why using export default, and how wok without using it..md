In ES6 modules, there are two main types of exports: named exports and default exports.

### Named Exports:
When you use named exports, you explicitly specify which variables, functions, or components you want to export from a module. You can have multiple named exports in a single module.

Example:
```javascript
export const App = () => {
  // Component definition
};
```

When importing named exports, you use the same name to reference the exported value.

Example:
```javascript
import { App } from './App';
```

### Default Exports:
A default export is used when a module exports a single value as its default export. You can only have one default export per module.

Example:
```javascript
const App = () => {
  // Component definition
};
export default App;
```

When importing a default export, you can choose any name to reference the exported value.

Example:
```javascript
import MyApp from './App';
```

### Why Use `default` Keyword:

- **Clarity**: Using `default` makes it clear that you're exporting the primary value from the module.
- **Consistency**: It maintains consistency when importing default exports across different modules.
- **Convenience**: Importing default exports without curly braces makes the import statement cleaner and more concise.

### Exporting Without `default`:
While it's technically possible to export without using `default`, it's less common and may lead to confusion, especially in larger projects. Using `default` for the primary export is a widely adopted convention in the JavaScript community.

However, you can export without `default` if you prefer:

```javascript
const App = () => {
  // Component definition
};
export { App };
```

But when importing, you'll need to use curly braces to destructure named exports:

```javascript
import { App } from './App';
```

In summary, while it's possible to export without using `default`, it's recommended to use `default` for the primary export to maintain clarity and consistency in your codebase.
