React Strict Mode is a developer tool that helps highlight potential problems in an application by enabling a set of strict checks in React's development mode. It does not affect the production build of the application.

When you wrap your application in `<React.StrictMode>`, React performs additional checks and warnings to help identify common issues such as:

1. Identifying unsafe lifecycle methods usage: React Strict Mode helps detect the usage of deprecated lifecycle methods (`componentWillMount`, `componentWillReceiveProps`, and `componentWillUpdate`) and alerts you to update your code to use their modern equivalents (`componentDidMount`, `componentDidUpdate`, and `getDerivedStateFromProps`).

2. Spotting legacy string ref usage: React Strict Mode warns you if your components use legacy string refs (e.g., `ref="myRef"`) instead of callback refs (e.g., `ref={myRef => this.myRef = myRef}`).

3. Detecting unexpected side effects: React Strict Mode helps identify unexpected side effects during rendering, such as mutating props or state inside render functions.

4. Highlighting potential issues with context usage: React Strict Mode checks for potential issues with context usage, such as mutations in context consumers.

Here's how you can use React Strict Mode in your application:

```jsx
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import App from './App';

ReactDOM.render(
  <React.StrictMode>
    <App />
  </React.StrictMode>,
  document.getElementById('root')
);
```

Wrap your main `<App />` component with `<React.StrictMode>` in your `index.js` or `App.js` file. React Strict Mode will then apply its checks to all components within the application.

It's important to note that React Strict Mode is only intended for use in development mode and should be removed from the production build of your application. It helps catch potential issues early in the development process, but it may also introduce false positives or additional console warnings that are not relevant to the final production build.
