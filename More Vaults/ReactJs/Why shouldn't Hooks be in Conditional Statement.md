Hooks in React are designed to be called in the same order on every render. Placing hooks inside conditional statements can lead to unpredictable behavior and violate this rule. Here are some reasons why hooks should not be used inside conditional statements:

1. **Consistent Order**: React relies on the order in which hooks are called to maintain component state between renders. Placing hooks inside conditional statements can cause them to be called conditionally, resulting in different hooks being called on different renders. This violates the fundamental rule of hooks and can lead to bugs and unexpected behavior.
    
2. **Violation of Rules of Hooks**: React's Rules of Hooks mandate that hooks should only be called at the top level of a functional component or from custom hooks. Placing hooks inside conditional statements breaks this rule and can result in errors at runtime.
    
3. **State Inconsistencies**: Placing hooks inside conditional statements can lead to inconsistencies in component state. For example, if a hook that sets state is conditionally called, the state may not be updated correctly on every render, leading to incorrect behavior.
    
4. **Memory Leaks**: Hooks such as `useEffect` can be used to perform cleanup actions when a component unmounts. Placing hooks inside conditional statements may prevent these cleanup actions from being performed, resulting in memory leaks and other performance issues.
    
5. **Readability and Maintainability**: Placing hooks inside conditional statements can make the code harder to read and understand. It can also make it more difficult to reason about the component's behavior and make it harder to debug issues.
    

In summary, while it may be tempting to use hooks inside conditional statements to conditionally apply behavior, it is generally best practice to avoid doing so to ensure that hooks are called in a consistent order on every render and to avoid violating the Rules of Hooks. Instead, consider using conditional rendering techniques such as ternary operators or logical && operators to conditionally render different parts of the component based on state or props.
