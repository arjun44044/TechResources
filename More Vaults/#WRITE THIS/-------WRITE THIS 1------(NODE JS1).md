1. ==**HOW PASS MIDDLEWARE WITH ROUTE()==**
To pass middleware functions when using `router.route().get()` in Express.js, you can include the middleware function(s) as additional arguments before the route handler function. Here's how you can do it:

### Basic Example:
```javascript
const express = require('express');
const router = express.Router();

// Middleware function
const myMiddleware = (req, res, next) => {
    console.log('Middleware executed');
    next(); // Pass control to the next middleware or route handler
};

// Route handler function
const myRouteHandler = (req, res) => {
    res.send('Hello from the GET route!');
};

// Applying middleware with router.route().get()
router.route('/myroute').get(myMiddleware, myRouteHandler);

module.exports = router;
```

### Explanation:
- **Middleware Function (`myMiddleware`)**: This function will be executed before the route handler (`myRouteHandler`). It typically performs tasks like authentication, logging, or modifying the request object.
- **Route Handler (`myRouteHandler`)**: This function handles the request once all the middleware functions have passed control by calling `next()`.

### Multiple Middleware Functions:
If you need to apply multiple middleware functions, you can pass them as additional arguments:

```javascript
const middleware1 = (req, res, next) => {
    console.log('Middleware 1 executed');
    next();
};

const middleware2 = (req, res, next) => {
    console.log('Middleware 2 executed');
    next();
};

router.route('/myroute').get(middleware1, middleware2, myRouteHandler);
```

### Use Case with Parameters:
If you need to pass middleware to a route with URL parameters:

```javascript
router.route('/user/:id').get(myMiddleware, (req, res) => {
    const userId = req.params.id;
    res.send(`User ID: ${userId}`);
});
```

### Summary:
- Middleware functions are passed as arguments before the route handler in `router.route().get()`.
- You can include multiple middleware functions by listing them in order before the handler.
- Each middleware function should call `next()` to pass control to the next middleware or the route handler.
